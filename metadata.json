  "description": "A simulation of an automated traffic control system for a 4-way intersection. The system uses priority queues for each lane (North, South, East, West) and automatically grants the green light to the lane with the highest-priority vehicle, such as an ambulance or fire truck. The frontend features a full visual simulation with animated vehicles and traffic signals.",
